# qPRAentry

`qPRAentry` is an R package encompassing functions for calculating and redistributing the potentially infected/infested quantity of commodities imported from countries where a pest of interest is present and estimating the amount of a pest entering a risk assessment area (in terms of potential founder populations landing in each region, e.g., European NUTS2). 

The package comprises two Shiny apps: one for computing $N_{trade}$ and redistributing, and the other for executing the pathway model.
