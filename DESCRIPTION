Description: The package is meant to support risk  assessors in performing the entry step of 
    the quantitative Pest Risk Assessments. It encompasses functions for calculating 
    and redistributing the quantity of commodities imported from countries 
    where a plant pest of interest is present and estimating the amount of a pest 
    entering a risk assessment area (in terms of founder populations 
    landing in each country/area/region). 
    The package comprises two Shiny apps: one for computing
    the potentially infected/infested quantity of commodities imported by a country of interest 
    from third-countries where a plant pest is present and redistributing this 
    quantity across regions, and the other for executing the pathway model.
    The package and functions used are based on the work of the European Food 
    Safety Authority (EFSA PLH Panel et al., 2018)
