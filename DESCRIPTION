Description: Supports risk  assessors in performing the entry step of 
    the quantitative Pest Risk Assessment. It allows the estimation 
    of the amount of a plant pest entering a risk assessment area 
    (in terms of founder populations) through the calculation of the imported 
    commodities that could be potential pathways of pest entry, 
    and the development of a pathway model. Two Shiny apps based on the 
    functionalities of the package are included, that simplify the process of 
    assessing the risk of entry of plant pests. The approach is based on 
    the work of the European Food Safety Authority
    (EFSA PLH Panel et al., 2018)
    <doi:10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5350>.
