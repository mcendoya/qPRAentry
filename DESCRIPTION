Description: The \bold{R} package \bold{qPRAentry} is provided to support risk assessors in performing 
    the entry step of the quantitative pest risk assessments. 
    The method expresses pest entry providing a distribution of the number of potential 
    founder populations that can establish in the risk assessment area as a result of entry. 
    The package encompasses functions for calculating and redistributing the quantity of 
    commodities imported from countries where a pest of interest is present.
    The package and functions used are based on the work of the European Food Safety Authority 
    (EFSA PLH Panel et al., 2018) <https://doi.org/10.2903/J.EFSA.2018.5350>.
